### About the Experiment 
Virtual experiments to study characteristics of plant cells and genomes.
Microscopic study of leaf cells is a fundamental component of plant biology education. It provides students with hands-on experience in observing biological structures and processes, fostering a deeper appreciation and understanding of plant anatomy and physiology. Research on leaf cells under the microscope can have practical applications in agriculture, forestry, and environmental science. For example, understanding how different plant species or cultivars respond to environmental stressors can inform crop breeding and management strategies.
