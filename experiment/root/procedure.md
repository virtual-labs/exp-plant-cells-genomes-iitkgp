## Procedure

Sample collection: Choose a fresh root of a plant.

#### Sample Preparation: 
- Select a healthy taproot and rinse it gently under running water to remove soil and debris.
- Trim the ends of the root to obtain a manageable length for sectioning.
- Place the taproot horizontally on a clean cutting surface.
- Use a sharp razor blade to make a clean transverse cut near the root tip. Make the cut perpendicular to the root axis.
- Transfer the root section immediately to a petri dish containing water to prevent dehydration and to keep the section intact.

#### Staining & Mounting:
- Use a pair of fine-pointed forceps to transfer the root section onto a glass microscope slide.
- Add 2- 3 drops solution of safranin for 2-5 minutes. Safranin stains lignified and cutinized cell walls red.
- Rinse the sections briefly in water to remove excess safranin.
- Add a drop of water to the leaf section to prevent drying out and to create a wet mount.
- Carefully place a coverslip over the leaf section, using a needle to gently lower it to and avoid trapping air bubbles.


#### Microscope Setup:
- Place the prepared slide on the stage of the simple microscope.
- Observe the section by turning the lowest magnification objective lens (usually 4x or 10x) and bring the sample into focus using the coarse and fine adjustment knobs.
- Once the sample is roughly in focus, switch to higher magnification objective lens (40x) to observe finer details of the internal cells of the root.


#### Observation: 
- Move the slide around using the stage controls to explore different regions of root 
- Observe various structures such as epidermis, endodermis, pericycle, meristematic cell etc.
- Take note of cell shape, size, arrangement, and any distinct features like root cap cell.
