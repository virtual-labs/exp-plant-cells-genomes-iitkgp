## Procedure

**To observe and study the structure of a flower by preparing and examining a longitudinal section under a microscope.**

#### Equipment required:
- Fresh flower specimen (e.g., Hibiscus)
- Sharp razor blade 
- Forceps
- Microscope slides 


#### Sample preparation:
1. Select a fresh, healthy flower
2. Ensure all tools (razor blade, forceps, needle) and the working area are clean to avoid contamination.

#### Dissection:
1. Carefully use forceps to hold the flower steady. Identify the main parts of the flower: stigma, style, ovary, petals, sepals, and stamens.
2. Using a sharp razor blade, make a longitudinal cut from the top (stigma) down to the bottom (ovary) of the flower. Aim to cut through the centre to reveal the internal structures.

#### Mounting:
1. Place the longitudinal section on a clean microscope slide.
2. Add a few drops of water or saline solution to keep the section hydrated.
3. Observation: Observe various structures such as: stigma, style, ovary, petals, sepals, and stamens.


**To observe and study the internal structure of a flower ovary by preparing and examining a transverse section under a microscope.**

#### Equipment required:
- Flower specimen (e.g., Hibiscus)
- Sharp Razor blade 
- Petri dish
- Needle 
- Forceps
- Microscope slides
- Cover slips
- Staining solution (e.g., safranin)
- Small brush
- Microscope


#### Sample Preparation:
1. Select a fresh flower with a mature ovary.
2. Carefully remove the ovary from the flower using dissecting tools.

#### Sectioning:
1. Use a sharp razor blade to cut a thin transverse section of the ovary. Ensure the section is thin enough to allow light to pass through for microscopic observation.
2. Using the edge of the blade, transfer these slices that carry the thin ovary section with the help of a brush into watch glass containing water. This helps maintain turgidity and prevents wilting during the observation.

#### Staining:
1. Use a pair of fine-pointed forceps to transfer the ovary section onto a glass microscope slide.
2. Apply a few drops of staining solution (e.g., safranin) to enhance the visibility of internal structures.
3. After staining, gently rinse with water to remove excess stain.

#### Mounting:
1. Carefully place a cover slip over the stained ovary section to create a flat, even surface for observation.
2. Ensure there are no air bubbles trapped under the cover slip.

#### Microscopic Examination:
1. Place the slide on the microscope stage.
2. Start with low magnification to locate the section, then switch to higher magnification to observe details.
3. Identify and note the key structures such as the ovary wall (pericarp), locules, ovules, and placental attachment.
